We assume that when a class is created, it will be used by programs to create objects of that type.
Sometimes it is useful to declare classes - called abstract classes - for which you never intend to create objects.
Because they are used as superclasses in inheritance hierarchies, we refer to them as abstract superclasses. These
classes cannot be used to instantiate objects because they are incomplete. Subclasses must declare the missing "pieces"
to become "concrete" classes from which you can instantiate objects.Otherwise these subclasses too will be abstract.
The purpose of an abstract class is to provide an appropriate superclass from which other classes can inherit
and thus share a common design.
