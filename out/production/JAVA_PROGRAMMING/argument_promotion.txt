ARGUMENT PROMOTION
---------------------

This is the conversion of an argument's value to the type that the method expects to receive in its corresponding
parameter.
Example: Math.abs() method accepts an integer although a double argument is expected. The int that is passed is promoted
to double before the absolute value is calculated. Such conversions may lead to compilation errors if the Java promotion
rules are not satisfied. These rules specify which conversions are allowed - that is which ones can be performed
without losing data. Conversion of int to double does not affect its value but conversion of double to int
truncates the fractional part and hence value is lost. Changing long to short integer may also truncate values.

The promotion rules apply to expression containing values of two or more primitive types and to primitive-type values
passed as arguments to methods. Each value is promoted to the highest type in the expression. The expression uses a
temporary copy of each value the types of the original values remains unchanged.

double --- valid promotion --- None
float --- valid promotion ---> double
long --- valid promotion ---> float,double
int --- valid promotion ---> long,float or double
char --- valid promotion ---> int,long,float,double
short --- valid promotion ---> int,long,float or double (not char)
byte --- valid promotion ---> short,int,long,float or double (not char)
boolean --- valid promotion ---> None (they are not numbers in java)
